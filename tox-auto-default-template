# This tox metadata file is used for several purposes:
# 
# The .TAGS:, .DESC:, and .GREPAT: are search aids, each is explained below.  The text outside of comment blocks is shell script that is executed when tox --run is invoked.
#
# TAGS are comma-delimited filter keys defined ad-hoc. They can be used to qualify tox operations which affect multiple directories. All TAGS must be on one line.  The tox --report with 't' option displays tags.
#
# .TAGS:
# 
# DESC is a single-line description of the directory. Typical use is to provide context for forgotten trees. The tox --report d option displays descriptions.
# .DESC:
#
# Anything not commented is shell script invoked with --run
